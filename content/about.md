## About

Critical Analysis Broadcasting started broadcasting in the Dunedin area in 2006. The low-power FM (LPFM) station was the brainchild of Ian Goldsmith, who was a presenter and DJ on the student radio station 91FM for many years. The current broadcast reaches from Opoho to Andersons Bay Road, or about six kilometres. The playlist has been carefully complied by Brett McDowell, while Martin Kean oversees the technical details.
